1. The i6Gesture database (i6G)
-------------------------------

The i6Gesture database was recorded in the course of the diploma thesis
work 'Appearance-Based Gesture Recognition' of Philippe Dreuw at the
Lehrstuhl fuer Informatik 6 of the RWTH Aachen University.


The new database of fingerspelling letters of German Sign Language
(Deutsche Gebärdensprache, DGS) contains 35 gestures with video
sequences for the signs A to Z and SCH, the German umlauts Ä, Ö, Ü, and
for the numbers 1 to 5. Five of the gestures contain inherent motion (J,
Z, Ä, Ö and Ü).

The recording was done under non-uniform daylight lighting conditions,
the back- ground and the camera viewpoints are not constant, and the
persons had no restrictions on the clothing while gesturing. The
database consists of 1400 image sequences that contain gestures of 20
different persons. Each person had to sign each gesture twice on two
different days. The gestures were recorded by two different cameras, one
webcam and one camcorder, from two different points of view.

The webcam recorded the sequences with a resolution of 320x240 at 25
frames per second, and the camcorder with a resolution of 352x288 at 25
frames per second. The persons were not trained to perform the signs,
therefrom the gestures may differ from the standard. For recording the
gestures we programmed a shell script which gave us the possibility
of recording and converting gestures for as many persons as we wanted
in a flexible and easy way. All videos were recorded in MPEG-4 DivX
format using the freely available software MPlayer. The script offers
possibilities to easily integrate new recording devices or changing the
record resolution and frame rate.

Also we programmed another shell script to convert the recorded videos
into single image files. For each person, session, and camera a sequence
file was generated which contains all images belonging to this sequence.
We chose the PNG image format with high compression factor but one may
change this to any other value. These two scripts are also available
online.

2. How to use the scripts to convert the video files into image sequences?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

After downloading the 'video' directory from the FTP server to your
working directory you have to adapt the filepath assignments in the
'registerRecordedGesture.sh' shell script to your needs.

E.g if you download the 'video' folder to '/home/yourname/I6-Gesture',
then you should adpat the filepath assignments as follows:

BASE_DIR="/home/yourname/I6-Gesture";    # base dir, prefix which will be used for all other dirs
EXAMPLE_DIR="${BASE_DIR}/examples"       # a path where you can store some example videos and images
DATA_DIR="${BASE_DIR}/data";             # all videos and images will be stored here
DATA_VIDEO_DIR="${DATA_DIR}/video";      # all videos will be stored here
DATA_IMAGE_DIR="${DATA_DIR}/image";      # all images, converted from the videos using the scripts, will be stored here
TEMP_DIR="/tmp";                         # temporary directory to convert the videos into image sequences

To convert then the video files into PNG image sequences, you have to
call 'registerRecordedGesturesAll.sh <session-id>', e.g. you have to
call 'registerRecordedGesturesAll.sh 1' and 'registerRecordedGesturesAll.sh 2' 
in order to convert both recording sessions into PNG files. This will
convert all 35 gestures of all 20 persons. If you encounter problems
when converting you might want use the other converting scripts like
'registerRecordedGesture.sh <PERSON_ID> <GESTURE_ID> <SESSION_ID>'.

The filenames are organized as follows:
e.g. /u/image/I6-Gesture/data/image/2/12_2_1_cam1.seq
-> gesture 2 (='B'), person id=12, session 1, camera 1 (=webcam)
e.g. /u/image/I6-Gesture/data/image/4/15_4_2_cam2.seq
-> gesture 4 (='D'), person id=15, session 2, camera 2 (=digicam)

The text file i6_data_P20_BOTH.txt was used to make person
independent experiments using leaving one out method. The file
i6_data_P20_SESSION_1.txt contains the training data (first session)
and the file i6_data_P20_SESSION_2.txt contains the test data
(second session) to make a person dependent experiment, as reported
in the paper. Of course you have to change these files according
to your needs, i.e. replace '/u/image/I6-Gesture' in the files to
'/home/yourname/I6-Gesture' using a search-and-replace tool like 'sed'.
The file is structured as follows:

<BASE_DIR> <NOF_GESTURES (=N)>
{
  <GESTURE_NAME_1> <NOF_PERSONS (=P)>
  <SEQUENCE_FILE_1>
  ...
  <SEQUENCE_FILE_P>
}
...
{
  <GESTURE_NAME_N> <NOF_PERSONS>
  <SEQUENCE_FILE_1>
  ...
  <SEQUENCE_FILE_P>
}





3. How to record new videos using the shell scripts?
----------------------------------------------------

The recording scripts will work on any video4linux device (e.g.
/dev/video) and you should adapt the scripts to your needs. We used a
Philips webcam _and_ an ordinary digi cam.
